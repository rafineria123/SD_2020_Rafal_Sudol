# NORGIE
This project was my first real Spring Boot & web app development experience. The goal of it was to create web app that:
1. gathers up-to-date data about discounts/codes/coupons from all over the world(mostly just Poland),
2. presents the data in elegant way,
3. allows users to find what they are looking for based on name/tag/shop and also other users' input(comments/ratings),
4. provides quite intuitive UI.

## Technologies:
- Spring Boot(Web, Security, Data JPA, Thymeleaf, Session),
- Maven,
- MySQL,
- HTML/JS/CSS.

## What is missing:
1. all kinds of tests,
2. both technical documentation & user documentation.
